# Proof of Impact (PoI) – Lite Whitepaper

**Proof of Impact (PoI)** is a decentralised, incentive-aligned protocol for verifiable global impact.

This repository contains the official lite version of the PoI whitepaper, outlining the core model, participation flow, token logic, and long-term vision.

## What is PoI?

PoI allows individuals to stake tokens to support real-world impact bounties (such as education, sustainability, access), which are fulfilled and verified digitally. Once the bounty is confirmed, the system returns the stake and issues protocol-defined rewards.

> No donations. No middlemen. No speculation. Just transparent action and aligned incentives.

## Why It Matters

PoI offers a new infrastructure for global coordination — where transparent impact is measurable, rewarded, and scalable. This system empowers individuals to contribute to global good without financial loss, while maintaining verifiable proof at every step.
