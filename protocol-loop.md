Proof of Impact (PoI) is a global, trustless coordination protocol that allows anyone to stake tokens toward verified real-world needs. Once funding is complete, the system sends aid directly to pre-verified recipients, and the blockchain transaction itself serves as final proof of fulfillment. This enables real-time global action without middlemen, bias, or bureaucracy.

## The Core Bounty Lifecycle

### 1. **Pre-Verified Recipient + Destination**
Before a bounty is published:
- The **individual or organisation** in need is verified (e.g. NGO, school, local rep)
- The **destination wallet, account, or payment method** is also verified
- Both are logged in the PoI verification registry for future use

### 2. **Bounty Goes Live**
- The bounty is published publicly
- It includes the purpose, funding target, recipient identity, and destination wallet
- Anyone can stake tokens toward the bounty up to the full target
- There is no voting or rejection — only participation

### 3. **Stake Threshold Met**
- Once the bounty is 100% funded, the system **automatically** sends the full amount to the verified destination
- Funds are delivered directly and immutably
- There is no need for fulfillers or additional approval

### 4. **Proof of Impact**
- The on-chain transaction itself is the **final proof of delivery**
- It is permanently recorded, timestamped, and verifiable
- No further confirmation is required

### 5. **Rewards + Treasury Growth**
- Stakers receive $POI token rewards for participating
- A % of each bounty round is allocated to the PoI Treasury to fund future bounties and ecosystem growth

## Proxy Node System (PoI Nodes)

In cases where recipients cannot be directly verified (e.g. due to lack of ID, internet, or digital wallets), the protocol allows **pre-verified proxy nodes** to receive and distribute aid on their behalf.

- PoI nodes are individuals or small teams verified by the protocol
- They are registered in the system and held to reputation standards
- Nodes extend reach to remote, offline, or undocumented populations while maintaining trustless coordination

## System Principles

- **Trustless by Default:** Proof = transaction receipt
- **Bias-Free:** No rejection or voting required
- **Global Inclusion:** Supports both connected and offline regions
- **Sustainable Treasury:** System grows with use
- **Permissionless:** Anyone can stake, anyone can participate
- **Extensible:** New layers (reputation, automation, governance) can be added later

## Future Expansion (Optional Layers)

These do not affect the core loop, but may be added to enhance functionality:
- Staking caps or tiered multipliers to prevent whale dominance
- Node reputation scores
- Automated bounty detection via AI or trend monitoring
- Smart contracts for auto-stake, treasury management, and payout logic
- On-chain or off-chain governance for protocol tuning

## Summary

PoI turns funding into verifiable action, with no middlemen and no delay. Every stake cycle results in direct aid, recorded proof, and growing momentum — all driven by public coordination and trustless infrastructure.
